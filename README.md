A public record of a class I taught in spring of 2024. This repository contains all of the source notebooks used in the class along with all additional resources used.

Lecture recordings are currently hosted on Google Drive due to GitHub's file size limits but will probably be moved over to YouTube at some point in the future. They can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1xMfSnIBL2Rx_JjzKO6HYCGvxbNa42nxy
