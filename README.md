A public record of a class I taught in the spring of 2024. This repository contains all of the source notebooks from the class along with all additional resources used.

Printed versions of the notebooks are also present for viewing on machines that don't have Mathematica installed.

Lecture recordings are currently hosted on Google Drive due to GitHub's file size limits but will probably be moved over to YouTube at some point in the future. They can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xMfSnIBL2Rx_JjzKO6HYCGvxbNa42nxy
